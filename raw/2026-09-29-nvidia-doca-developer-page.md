# NVIDIA DOCA Software Platform
# Accelerate application development for NVIDIA BlueField and ConnectX networking devices.
NVIDIA DOCA™ unlocks the potential of the NVIDIA® BlueField® platform. By harnessing the power of BlueField DPUs and SuperNICs, DOCA enables the rapid creation of applications and services that offload, accelerate, and isolate data center workloads. It lets developers create software-defined, cloud-native, DPU- and SuperNIC-accelerated services with zero-trust protection, addressing the performance and security demands of modern data centers. DOCA-Host includes all needed host drivers and tools for your NVIDIA BlueField and NVIDIA® ConnectX® devices.

Together, DOCA and the BlueField platform enable the development of applications that deliver breakthrough networking, security, and storage performance. BlueField isolates the infrastructure service domain from the workload domain to offer significant improvements in application and server performance, security, and efficiency, giving developers all the tools they need to realize optimal, secure, accelerated data centers and AI clouds. DOCA software consists of an SDK and a runtime environment. The DOCA runtime, included by default with the BlueField platform, has tools for provisioning, deploying, and orchestrating containerized services on hundreds or thousands of DPUs and SuperNICs across the data center. The DOCA SDK provides industry-standard open APIs and software frameworks. The SDK supports a range of operating systems and distributions and includes drivers, libraries, tools, documentation, and example applications. DOCA-Host is the DOCA package for host installation and includes several installation profiles to best fit your data center workflows. DOCA-Host provides the needed interfaces for NVIDIA networking platforms, including both BlueField and ConnectX devices.

## Platform and Host Deployments
### DOCA on the BlueField Platform
The NVIDIA BlueField platform, powered by the DOCA software framework, is an advanced computing platform for data center infrastructure, delivering accelerated software-defined networking, storage, security, and management services at massive scale.
### DOCA on the Host
NVIDIA BlueField and NVIDIA ConnectX are paired with DOCA to deliver Ethernet and InfiniBand connectivity solutions at speeds up to 800 gigabits per second (Gb/s). Built on an open foundation, the DOCA-host package includes essential drivers and tools to enhance networking performance and enable advanced functionality. DOCA software is available on every leading operating system as a standalone package (without a bundled OS) for Arm® and x86 architectures.
